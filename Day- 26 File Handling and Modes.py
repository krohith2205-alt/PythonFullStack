# File Handling: File handler is an object that gives more options like creating, updating

# two ways to open the file...

# 1.open():

# syntax --> do = open('file_name','mode')
           
# ex:

do = open('demo.txt','r')
print(do.read())

#2.with (keyword):

# syntax --> with open('file_name','mode') as do:

# ex:

with open('demo.txt','r') as do:
    print(do.read())

# Modes:

# r --> used to read the file, incase if the file is not present it will raise error.

# w --> used to write the text inside the file

# ex:

with open('dem.txt','w') as do:
    print(do.write('we are using file handling'))

# a --> this is used to add the text at last position inside the file.

# ex:

with open('dem.txt','a') as do:
    print(do.write('\nshankarooooooooooooooooo'))

# x --> used to create a new by adding the inside the file, incase if the file is present it will raise an error.

# ex:

with open('dem.txt','x') as do:
    print(do.write('\nshankarooooooooooooooooo'))

#write(): this function is used to add the text inside a file or update a file with new text.

#ex:

with open('demo.txt','r') as do:
    print(do.write(10))


# read(): used to read a file and this read() will read file chunk by chunk. we can also specify the size. 

# ex:

with open('demo.txt','r') as do:
    print(do.read(10))
    
# readline(): this readline() function will read only one line at a time...

#ex:

with open('demo.txt','r') as do:
    print(do.readline(10))
    
# readlines(): this function will read whole file and give it in a list each line is one index in that list....

#ex:

with open('demo.txt','r') as do:
    print(do.readlines())

with open('demo.txt','r') as do:
    print(do.readline(10))
